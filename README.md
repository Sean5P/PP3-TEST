## Overview
DataDigestor is (will be) an advanced command-line tool designed for importing, analysing, and exporting survey data.
It will simplify the process of converting raw survey data into insightful, actionable reports, making it invaluable for researchers, data analysts, and marketing professionals.

## Features (Objectives)
- **Data Import:** Import Survey Data from Multiple Sources / File Tyoes (CSV files etc).
- **Data Parsing:** Provide Customisable Parsing to Organise Survey Data Effectively.
- **Data Analysis:** Features Various Algorithms for In-depth Data Analysis.
- **Data Export:** Allows Users to Export Findings into Structured Files.

### Current Features
* From the Main Menu, users can choose from Options Available to view Results.

### Future Features
The Intent is to Develop the application further to Include the following Features / Functions... 

- Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Develop a user-friendly GUI for users who are less comfortable with command-line interfaces. This can include intuitive navigation, data visualization, and easy-to-use controls for data import/export.

- Advanced Data Visualization:
Integrate Data visualization Capabilities, allowing users to create graphs, charts, heatmaps etc directly from the analysed data. This can include bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and more.

- Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis:
Implement Machine Learning Algorithms to offer predictive analysis based on the survey data. This could be used to forecast trends, identify patterns, or make recommendations.

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Add features for data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, remove duplicates, or correct inconsistencies in the survey data.

- Custom Report Generation:
Enable users to generate custom reports with a choice of insights to include, formatting options, and the ability to add custom annotations or summaries.

- Real-Time Data Processing:
Enable Real-time Data Processing, allowing users to upload data to receive instant analysis that can be particularly useful for live surveys or continuous data collection.

- API Integration:
Provide Integration with various data sources or platforms via APIs, allowing users to import data directly from other tools or services.

- Multi-Language Support:
Offer support for multiple languages in the tool's interface and documentation to cater to a global user base.

- Collaborative Features:
Include Capabilities for Multiple Users to Collaborate on the same dataset, with features like shared projects, version control, and user access management.

- Extended Data Support:
Expand the types of data formats that can be imported and processed, such as Excel files, JSON, or data from SQL databases.

- Customisable Data Analysis Scripts:
Allow users to write or customise their own data analysis scripts or modules that can be plugged into the tool.

- Automated Insights and Recommendations:
Develop features that automatically generate insights and recommendations based on the analysed data, tailored to the user's specific goals or interests.

- Mobile App Version:
Create a mobile application version of the tool for users to access and analyse data on the go.

- Enhanced Security Features:
For sensitive data, add robust security features like data encryption, secure login, and compliance with data protection regulations.

- User Feedback and Support System:
Implement a system for users to provide feedback, request features, or get support directly through the application.
